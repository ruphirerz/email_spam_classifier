Spam is becoming a serious threat for regular users of emails, businesses and corporate firms. In this presentation we have applied decision tree algorithm on the set of emails which consist of spam and ham attachments collected from sources.

Result analysis on test data shows accuracy of the model and can be considered to be good enough whenever training time is being considered as a critical parameter because it takes minimum training time than a lot of other algorithms. 

Therefore considering overall performance and from stimulation results, that the model can be used safely for building reliable spam filters.

The model looks for files being attached along with the email and judges whether it is SPAM or not. It looks for certain file extensions which generally have malicious content encrypted and reject any such attachment.
